# what_to_do_ubuntu
A repository to take you through the installation procedure for ubuntu 16.04 , as I have done.For freshers , with love.

I'd like to thank a lot of people for introducing me to open-source . So , this is me just passing the knowledge :).For any queries , feel free to contact me via [mail](mailto:hiwarekaustubh@gmail.com) or drop a [message on Facebook.](http://facebook.com/kaustubhhiware)

Please note: This README will be update daily. So, It would be better to share your ideas through 
issues, rather than PR's. Pull requests would be great after 20th July, till then please bear with me.

# Installation prep-talk

This guide will be majorly focoused on Ubuntu 16.04 , but is valid for a range of open-source OS's.
If you wish to install only ubuntu , you may skip this part , but it doesn't hurt to know.Most of the people prefer dual boot ,that is installing Windows as well as Linux on the same computer.
Also, if you are going for dual-boot, install Windows first.You might face a lot of unnecessary problems if you try to install Windows after Ubuntu.Most laptops coming with pre-installed Windows , I'd advice you not to remove Windows.

## Choose your OS

There are a lot of OS out there , so choose wisely.(To add an image here , distributing users by their OS.)(Find what a guide if possible.)

## Installation Guide

Although this is uncommon , a backup is suggested. In the last few attempts, it has been observed that backing up the C: drive suffices , if you do not have enough memory . However , this may not be true in all cases.
