How to contribute
=================

- Avoid using 'I','me', casually use 'you' but prefer 'user', speak in past perfect tense.
- Try not to use long sentences.
- Try to add scripts for what you add - most of them could be found online.
- Cite the reference. Give credit where it is due.
- Add images for chrome extensions
- Spread the word! Sometimes, just being there and letting others know is all that matters.
